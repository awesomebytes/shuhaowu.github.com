title: Ohai Mozilla!

Ohai Mozilla! As of about March this year, Mozilla decided that I was cool
enough to join their awesome team in Mountain View, California as a summer
intern. I still can't really believe that this is happening, even as I sit in 
an airport waiting for my flight to Chicago (and then San Jose).

I never actually seriously thought about working in the tech industry this
summer until some of my friends suggested that I should apply for the hell of it.
A special shout out to [@ryanseys](http://ryanseys.com) as he gave me the 
idea of applying to Mozilla (who knew they hired, right?) (disclaimer: he is
a Mozillian too!).

I will be interning with the web development team and I look forward to the next
15 weeks! If anyone is in the Bay Area, feel free to [give me a shout](/contact).
