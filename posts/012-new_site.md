title: New website!
date: 2013-11-10 21:30

After about 4 hours of fiddling around with my website, I finally ported this
site to [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/). It was long overdue as the
looks of the old site was pretty boring, not to mention being a disaster on 
mobile.

Here is a list of all the major changes from this changeset:

 - The home page has been simplified. All sections are now 3 sentences or less.
 - The showcase page has been completely revamped to include screenshots and 
   a friendlier look.
 - The blog is now one column.
 - The entire site is now based on Foundation 4.
 - The mobile site does not make me want to gouge my eyes out.

Some other things that still need to be worked on:

 - Include a comment section for the blog.
 - Include a print friendly version of my CV.
