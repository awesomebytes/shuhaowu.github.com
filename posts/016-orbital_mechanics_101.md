title: Orbital Mechanics 101
published: no

Orbital mechanics is a field of study that involves the orbits of celestrial
bodies as well as man made objects. If you ever played Kerbal Space Program, you
should be at least somewhat familiar with what that is. Today, we will explore
some of the basic mathematics behind those.

I am currently enrolled in this class in my university, and I want to take this
opportunity to try an experiment, where I attempt to summarize what I've learned
so far in a series of mini lessons and interactive demos. Please be advised that
you will need an up to date browser to view this. Mobile may not be well tested,
so <abbr title="your milage may vary">YMMV</abbr>.
