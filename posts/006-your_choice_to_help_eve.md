title: It is your choice to help Eve
published: no

[Recent revelations][relevations] about [the NSA spying on everyone](wiki-
prism) caused many people from the tech community to think about the state of
the current information security. I have spent a considerable amount of time
over the past month or so thinking and discussing about the matter and came up
with some interesting revelations.

There are [already][r1] [many][r2] [reports][r3] telling us what the NSA is
doing, so I will refrain from doing the same. There are also
[plenty][r4] of [articles][r5] that describes the implications of PRISM. These
are not what this post is about. Instead, I want to talk about the people
aspect of surveillance.

Maybe you forget, or at least I don't really see it being mentioned in the
reports of the subject matter, that the NSA is not really a single human being,
but rather, a collection of human beings. Many of them are not aware that what
they are doing is harmful to the society as a whole as they may not have the
whole picture before this. There are probably a [handful][p1] of [people][p2]
that know about the extent of the Thought Police, but they are human beings
too, subject to everything that are subject to us in terms of being human.
However, we can assume that the vast majority of those working for the NSA are
"good" and probably do not condone programs such as PRISM as they probably do
not know about it (and this could happen if they are working on it).

This situation, while vastly different from the threats we learned in
cryptography class, is actually not that different from the threats we learned
in cryptography class. In those classes, we learned that there are a small
minority of people who have malicious intent are the ones that we need to
defend from and they are subject to the same limitations as the good guys are.
While in this case the bad guys are not subject to the same [limitations][fisa]
as we are, they are subject to the same limitation in terms of technical
abilities as we are (though they have vastly more funds, but they *probably*
have to use the same kind of technologies as we do, and hire the same kind of
people as we do).

Now if we dig a little deeper, we realize that these malicious agents are
actually subject to *more* restrictions than us. For one, these agents do not
have any technical abilities of their own, but rely on technical abilities of
others to carry out malicious act, perhaps by deceiving those that are
implementing these impressive technologies.

And perhaps, if we were to give Eve the benefit of the doubt, her
original intention may not have been bad. It may have been what she said it is
when her acts are revealed to the public. However, as we know,
[power corrupts][power] and her original intention has been/could be replaced
by a different one that only benefits herself and harms everyone else.

Ultimately, PRISM (and other programs) are created by people and these people
have the ability to think for themselves and make their own judgments on what
is right and what is wrong.

So in the wake of PRISM, we should ask ourselves: should we really work for the
NSA (or similar agencies) if given the opportunity? Sure, they can try to lure
you in the slogan of protecting your country, but will you really be protecting
your own country? And even if so, at what price? Sure, they can lure you with
high salary and benefits, but will you feel good about taking that money? And
even if so, can you really ignore the implications of what you are doing?

I agree, it is a fine line to walk on. Civilians need to be protected as there
are a small minority of malicious agents out there trying to do harm. However,
the protectors are usually equipped with the same gear as those trying to do
harm. It is ultimately your choice to use it correctly.

What I am saying is that we, the people, need to oppose programs such as PRISM
using productive methods in our disposal. Some may decide to boycott insecure
services. Some may decide to write to their representatives. This will help if
enough people started to do something about this.

There are also those in the position that can say no to all of this. If you
are one of those, please use your best judgment.
