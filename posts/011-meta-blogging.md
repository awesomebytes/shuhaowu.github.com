title: Happy Monday: Meta blogging
date: 2013-11-04 14:45

Happy Monday folks! It is two days away from two major exams for me, so I
better keep my tradition of writing posts at _slightly_ inconvenient
times.

It occurred to my that over the years, I have 
[written plenty of code](https://github.com/shuhaowu). I would also say that I
have gotten a lot better as a programmer from all the practise that I had.

Over the same time, the amount of words that I write went down. As an
engineering student, there are very few assignments that make us write things 
without tainting it with pages and pages of tables, equations, and diagrams. 
This lack of practise has put me out of touch with communicating with writing as
I often struggle to write about things and events that I find interesting. 
On top of that, English is my second language and writing in it is not
my strong suit to begin with, so I feel like this is a problem that I have to
address.

Incidentally, it is also [NaNoWriMo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Novel_Writing_Month),
where people try to write an entire novel in a month. In honour of that, I
thought I would try to take some time out of my schedule to write. Not a novel (I know :[),
but blogposts on things that I find interesting.

I'll come up with ;)
