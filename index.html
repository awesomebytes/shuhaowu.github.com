		<h2>Welcome!</h2>
		<p>My name is Shuhao Wu. I'm a current student in Lo-Ellen Park Secondary School and develop software in my spare time.</p>
		<p>My primary language is Python. Although I'm familiar with a wide variety of programming languages.</p>
		<p>I have a blog/project site at <a href="http://thekks.net">http://thekks.net</a>. This site is for me to write blog posts and host other projects that I have going on.</p>

		<h4>Python</h4>
		<p>Python is a great programming language! There's nothing bad that I could say about the language, really.</p>
		<p>This is my primary programming language as I'm most experienced in it. In fact, this website's generator is written in Python + Flask.</p>
		<p>Also, another language that I've beginning to like very much is GNU Octave. Great modeling language, great substitute for matplotlib for prototyping.</p>
		<p>Though, we all need to move to Python 3.x!</p>

	<div class="four columns">
		<h4>Open Source</h4>
		<p>Open source is a great way to develop software. Most of my code that I've decided is not garbage enough is on <a href="http://github.com/ultimatebuster">Github</a>.</p>
		<p>Someone's garbage is another's treasure. There are some stuff that I've developed when I needed to use it. However, then I discovered more interesting things and moved on!</p>
		<p>Currently, my main open source effort is on <a href="http://github.com/ultimatebuster/riakkit">Riakkit</a>, an object mapper for Riak. You can find more of my projects in the <a href="/showcase/">showcase</a> page.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="four columns">
		<h4>FRC</h4>
		<p>FRC is the FIRST Robotics Competition. This competition is a high school level robot competition that has more than 45000 students building robots to accomplish a certain task.</p>
		<p>I am currently involved with the program as the captain and lead programmer of <a href="http://loellenrobotics.com">Team 4069 (Lo-Ellen Robotics)</a>.</p>
		<p>This year, we are working on a basketball shooter. My main goal is to get a reasonably accurate auto shooter programmed in Java.</p>
