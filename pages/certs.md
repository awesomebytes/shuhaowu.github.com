title: Certificates

Privacy is a big deal. When systems such as [PRISM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29) exist, we cannot trust that our communication is completely private. This page is created as a response to such threats and provide you a method of authenticating my identity as well as sending me private contents without the fear of anyone eavedropping.

Since this website is completely unencrypted, it is feasible for an active attacker to alter the content of this page. Hence, I have published all of my certificates and their fingerprints on Github. Github is currently SSL-only and should be able to be trusted.

It is recommended that you do **not** import my certificate authority unless it becomes necessary (such as when you connect to multiple services that I offer) and verify the fingerprints as needed.
