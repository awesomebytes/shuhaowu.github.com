title: Certificates

Privacy is a big deal. When systems such as [PRISM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_%28surveillance_program%29) exist, we cannot trust that our communication is completely private. This page is created as a response to such threats and provide you a method of authenticating my identity as well as sending me private contents without the fear of anyone eavesdropping.

I do not have a view for the certificates on this site yet. You can however
find my certificates on Github.

It is recommended that you do **not** import my certificate authority unless it becomes necessary (such as when you connect to multiple services that I offer) and verify the fingerprints as needed.
