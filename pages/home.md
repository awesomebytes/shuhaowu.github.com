# Hello &#9731; #

My name is Shuhao Wu. I'm an Aerospace Engineering student at Carleton
University. I'm also a software developer during my off hours and summer
times.

Throughout my life, I wish to help in the advancement of humanity as a whole
and lessen the suffering of those who are in trouble along the way.

#### Codin' ####
Making things in my spare time is fun. Coding is a huge part of that as there
are always things to make.

#### Open Source ####

Sharing is caring, so almost everything I make is open source.
Hopefully one day something of mine will help others. :)
