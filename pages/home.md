Welcome!
--------
My name is Shuhao Wu. I'm an Aerospace Engineering student at Carleton
University. I'm also currently working at Mozilla as a web development intern.

Throughout my life, I wish to help in the advancement of humanity as a whole 
and lessen the suffering of those who are in trouble along the way.

#### Codin' ####
Yeah. I code in my spare time. A lot of what I write are things that I
need/want and I've contributed to other people's projects as well.

I love how it is possible to come up with an idea, sit down, code for a couple
hours and come up with a workable prototype. 

Current interests:

 - Data mining/ML/Data visualization. 
 - Scaling web application backends.
 - Autonomous robotics, self navigating robots.

#### Open Source ####
Open source is awesome. There is nothing better than free (as in freedom)
software as it promotes so much innovation! (Maybe we should bring this to
aerospace...)

To give back to the open source community as I benefited a great deal from it,
code that I've written is also online on [Github](https://github.com/shuhaowu).

I am currently also an intern for Mozilla, an amazing company that is all about
open source. To learn more about them, [click here](http://mozilla.org).

#### Side projects ####
Side projects are awesome. I usually have a couple going on at the same time.
Right now I'm working on a web app that's a rewrite of 
[spm](https://github.com/shuhaowu/spm) and it should be released soon.

Besides coding, I try to do some hardware hacks as well. Once I get some time,
I'm going to sit down and model a couple of hardware modifications/additions
to a music box set.
