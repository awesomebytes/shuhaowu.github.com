Welcome!
--------
My name is Shuhao Wu. I'm an Aerospace Engineering student at Carleton
University. I'm also currently working at Mozilla as a web development intern.

This website is setup to showcase all my things that I made over the years.
Please feel free to look around for yourself!

#### Codin' ####
Yeah. I code in my spare time. A lot of what I write are things that I
need/want and I've contributed to other people's projects as well.

My main goal is to sit down, come up with something awesome, and get it done.
It's not necessarily possible in all circumstances due to constraints, I try my
best.

Current interests:

 - Web applications (single page) with REST server and Backbone/CoffeeScript
 - Data mining/ML/Data visualization. Big data is fun.
 - Autonomous robotics, self navigating robots.

#### Open Source ####
Open source is awesome. There is nothing better than free (as in freedom)
software as it promotes so much innovation! (Maybe we should bring this to
aerospace...)

To give back to the open source community as I benefited a great deal from it,
code that I've written is also online on [Github](https://github.com/shuhaowu)

Current efforts:

 - [Levelupdb](https://github.com/shuhaowu/levelupdb) is a database server that
   is built on leveldb and is a clone of Riak, except it is designed to run on
   a single, low powered node (perfect for your side projects). The API is
   compatible with Riak so you can easily upgrade.
 - [Riakkit](https://github.com/shuhaowu/riakkit) is an object mapper for riak
   in python.
 - [Leveldbkit](https://github.com/shuhaowu/leveldbkit) is an object mapper for
   leveldb in python. The API is almost compatible with Riakkit, allowing for
   easy transitions.

#### Side projects ####
Side projects are awesome. I usually have a couple going on at the same time.
Right now I'm in the process of creating an app that serves as an
extension to Google Calendar and hopefully that will be out soonish.

Besides coding, I try to do some hardware hacks as well. Once I get some time,
I'm going to sit down and model a couple of hardware modifications/additions
to a music box set.
