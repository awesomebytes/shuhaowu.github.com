#### Active Projects <small>Active development or available for use</small> ####
<dl>
<dt>[Riakkit](https://github.com/shuhaowu/riakkit)</dt>
<dd>Riakkit is an object mapper similar to MongoKit and CouchdbKit but for Riak. This is one of the most sophisticated of its kind for Riak and is currently being tested at an ongoing project.</dd>
<dt>[Levelupdb](https://github.com/shuhaowu/levelupdb)</dt>
<dd>A high performance single node key-value database designed for low end boxes. Riak API Clone. Written in Go</dd>
<dt>[leveldbkit](https://github.com/shuhaowu/leveldbkit)</dd>
<dd>Leveldbkit is a leveldb object mapper for Python. It includes a way to do secondary indexes.</dd>
<dt>[Funnel](https://github.com/shuhaowu/Funnel)</dt>
<dd>Funnel is a system to convert markdown into a static website. It also includes a way to add blog posts. This portfolio is created using this tool and deployed to github pages.</dd>

#### In-active Projects <small>No longer with any development</small> ####
<dl>
<dt>[Colorado School Grade Visualizations](http://csgv.shuhaowu.com)</dt>
<dd>Developed for a [kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/visualize-the-state-of-education-in-colorado).</dd>
<dt>[Automatic Document Classification](http://rdc.thekks.net)</dt>
<dd>The Stanford AI and ML class taught me a lot. So why not put the knowledge to use! I did this for a project for my math class in school as well. With more time, I will eventually implement more things. So this is semi-inactive. This site may be up and down as it is running from my room with a VPN to a rev proxy...</dd>
<dt>[Go pong](https://github.com/shuhaowu/gopong)</dt>
<dd>A learning project for Go. It replicates the pong game and adds some extra features. Video: [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWwlvhQ1SdU)</dd>
<dt>[Sudbury Realtime Bus Tracker](http://bus.shuhaowu.com)</dt>
<dd>After trying out Sudbury's "realtime" bus tracker, I hated it. So I hacked together a quick app that actually does realtime update, stop bookmarks, and so on.</dd>
<dt>[plugin-based-core](https://github.com/shuhaowu/plugin-based-core)</dt>
<dd>I did this when I first learned programming. Back then, I was intriguied about how Eclipse was able to have a really small core size and accomplish everything with plugins. Without realizing it, I developed a topological sorting algorithm that worked. Was quite impressed (and disappointed in my implementation) when I learned topological sorting after the fact.</dd>
<dt>[liteFramework](https://github.com/shuhaowu/liteframework)</dt>
<dd>Back in the days of PHP (and when I didn't have access to anything other
than shared hosting), I had a great interest in developing a system that could
mimic the effects of Django in PHP. However, it turned out that PHP was not a
language that I could make that happen without a considerable amount of
headaches. After many weeks of head scratching, I finally gave up on the
project and transfered my entire web development efforts into Python. This
also briefly ran a local business website.</dd>

#### Fun projects <small>Projects I made for fun, may not have any further development</small> ####
<dl>
<dt>[AI Server](https://github.com/shuhaowu/aiserver)</dt>
<dd>A server designed for me to take a peek into the networking world.
 Also, easy to use for simple turn based games with a horrible horrible protocal.</dd>
<dt>[pidgin-log-parser](https://github.com/shuhaowu/pidgin-log-parser)</dt>
<dd>A regex based data-mining Pidgin Log Parser. Born out of a MSN conversation,
this parser could mine words for each person and what not.</dd>
</dl>


#### Contributions <small>Me contributing to other projects</small> ####
<dl>
<dt>[Emesene](https://github.com/emesene/emesene)</dt>
<dd>A great MSN client for Linux. Written with PyGTK, it works really well for a client that's not made by MS and uses MS protocal. I've contributed to this project in Sept 2011, but then I discovered imo.im and ran out of time.</dd>
<dt>[Open Intents](http://code.google.com/p/openintents/)</dt>
<dd>Contributed to this during Google Code In. Currently has no time to continue contributing.</dd>
<dt>[ninja-ide](https://github.com/ninja-ide/ninja-ide)</dt>
<dd>My current IDE so of course I'll contribute to it.</dd>
<dt>[CyanogenMod](http://review.cyanogenmod.org/#/dashboard/4229)</dt>
<dd>Doesn't really count as I only submitted a patch.. but in my opinion an awesome patch. No one really looked at it, however.</dd>
<dt>[riak-python-client](https://github.com/basho/riak-python-client)</dt>
<dd>Some patches here and there..</dd>

#### Me online ####
<p>You can find me on [Github](https://github.com/shuhaowu), [Ohloh](https://www.ohloh.net/accounts/Shuhao), and now, apparently, [Softpedia](http://webscripts.softpedia.com/developer/Shuhao-Wu-1869786286.html). Though the latter only list pretty much my inactive projects.</p>
