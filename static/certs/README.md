Certificates
============

Here is the directory containing all my certificates. Feel free to use this to
send me an encrypted message or to verify my identity.

Please ensure that you're browsing this on https://github.com and the current
page is secured (https is enabled and you didn't accept invalid certificates)

Certificates available here. If you do not want to import, please verify the
fingerprints.

 - `certauthority.pem`: My certificate authority. Valid until June 10th 2018
    - MD5 Fingerprint: ED 31 4B 0F 9E 95 DF F1 E9 1B C5 D0 35 CE AA AC
    - SHA1 Fingerprint: F2 39 1C 98 FA 10 AA B0 54 F9 50 AA 16 83 DB 75 67 4F 04 47
    - Note: You can use to verify everything hosted by me unless it is a web
      server. Those I will probably be using StartSSL and they will be added
      here.
 - `shuhao@shuhaowu.com.pem`: My email certificate. Valid until June 11th 2015
    - MD5 Fingerprint: B2 6B 20 02 ED 4B C4 6B C2 D5 A6 AA 90 4B 73 0A
    - SHA1 Fingerprint: A5 00 26 5C 39 F6 CE BF 93 AE 58 F9 11 93 36 7A 1C 82 96 B7
    - Note: You can expect me to use this to sign my emails.
    - **Warning**: I use Google Apps and chances are everything sent from and
      received at this address will be logged by someone like the NSA. If
      desired, you can send me an email encrypted with this public key. Please
      note that email leaks metadata (all headers, including from, to, subject
      and so forth) and those data will **not** be private.
 - shuhaowu.com.crt : Certificate for shuhaowu.com. Valid until June 16th 2013
    - MD5 Fingerprint: 49 2C 1C 99 C1 FD 93 FD 94 CE B2 C6 8E F1 27 9F

    - Note: This is signed by StartSSL and therefore should work on all major
      browsers out of the box.
