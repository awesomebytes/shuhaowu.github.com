          <li>In this presentation, we will be talking about how to make an webapp work offline.</li>
          <li>I'm going to primarily talk about how to build one from the ground up. However, the concepts should not be that foreign if you're converting and existing one offline. More on that later.</li>
          <li>You're gonna need a variety of "cutting edge" technologies. These technologies are cutting edge not because they are new, but because they can cut you... and you will bleed... at least initially</li>
          <li>Eventually you learn not to hold these tools in a way that could cut you...</li>

          <li>So why would we want to build an offline HTML5 app?</li>
          <li>Because we can.</li>
          <li>Because customers demand it.</li>
          <li>Because the apps we write are already written with web technologies.</li>
          <li>Because web apps are truly cross platform... as long as there is a browser</li>
          <li>Because it saves a lot of bandwidth as web applications are big nowadays.</li>
          <li>Because we do not have to maintain many different code bases.. one for Android, one for iOS...</li>
          <li>Because browsers are probably fast enough to do most of what you need to do</li>
          <li>Because CSS is awesome... actually I'm not a big fan :(</li>

          <li>In my opinion, some sort of JS framework is a must.</li>
          <li>Usually it helps you with view switching (routing), rendering, code structures, among with other things.</li>
          <li>Writing jQuery blobs suck. Do not want!</li>
          <li>Imagine writing something as complicated as Shopify with only CGI. That would be terrible!</li>
          <li>Since your app is purely offline, writing JS with some framework almost feel like writing backend code</li>
          <li>Some frameworks are quite heavy. Angular uses something called dirty checking, which is fairly slow (though still acceptable) on a lower end Android or a regular Firefox OS device.</li>

        <li>Some choices: Angular, Backbone, Batman, Ember</li>
        <li>If you don't want frameworks: imagine writing a complicated server side app with only CGI</li>

          <li>localStorage is the first choice. It is very easy to work with, essentially a big hashtable.</li>
          <li>Lacks a lot of features from a more traditional database. </li>
          <li>Storing objects requires you to serialize into a JSON string first.</li>
          <li>Annoying to work with if you have a lot of data to work with. You need to come up with your own way to segregate, index the data.</li>
          <li>Good if your data is fairly minimal. Example: todo list, notepad</li>
          <li>Fairly tedious if you want something more complicated like the offline SUMO app.</li>

          <li>As you can see, everything is very verbose. It is pretty annoying to write code like this.</li>
          <li>There are some attempts to make this easier to use. However I find those libraries tend to hide too much of IndexedDB.</li>
          <li>Angular uses its own $q promises. I created a wrapper that allows you to use the angular promises API to access idb.</li>
          <li>This is something we have to overcome essentially. You should be separating your data layer from your view controller (I use a service in angular).
          This way you don't have to think about it too much after you coded (and tested) your data layer.</li>
          <li>Either way there are still a lot of pain. Error code are pretty mysterious at first. For my framework, a lot of errors, which are your fault, will emit from a function named "genericSuccess"</li>

          <li>Appcache sucks. It is useful, but it really sucks.</li>
          <li>There are a lot of catches. I'm not going to document all of it as it has been thorougly documented.</li>
          <li>Really difficult to work in. For example: if you create a new file, you need to update the appcache manifest file. If you updated a file, you need to change a comment indicating the version of the manifest so your app would update. See more at the page in the slide.</li>
          <li>What ends up happening is that you want to generate your appcache manifest file so you don't need to spend a lot of time keeping it up to date, and so forth,</li>
          <li>This is why I created a module for it for flask. That takes care of the manifest stuff so you only have to worry about the JS implementation and one line in html. It takes a coffee break to implement appcache for your app (6 minutes for me)</li>
          <li>
            One thing I noticed recently is that my data usage has gone app. Most of it came from my browser. My theory is that I recently switched from a couple of native apps to a couple of webapps. None of these have appcache. So everytime I load them once the default cache expires.. it is a megabyte or two.
          </li>
          <li>
            If we pushed all of that into appcache, users do not have to pay to download our content everytime, this means happier users.

          <li>To see what I mean last time, you can see an example file.</li>
          <li>Notice the version. The following is a hash of the content for all of the objects in the cache.</li>
          <li>We cache all our static files and /. The / simply has the base template. Angular will render the rest.</li>
          <li>Fallback has some nice properties. What it does is everytime the browser encounters an URL it has not seen before while being offline, it will render the fallback url (which in this case is also /) but retains the URL that the user specified. This means that angular will be able to find the correct URL route and render the correct view.</li>
          <li>Enable HTML5 pushState as it works well with fallback.</li>

    </hgroup>
    <article>
      <ul>
        <li>You should definitely take your app offline
          <ul>
            <li>Especially if it is suppose to be a substitute for the native app on mobile</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Be careful with some of these technologies: they may not be supported on a lot of devices</li>
        <li>Many pain points but hopefully will be okay</li>
        <li>Very cutting edge, not a lot of examples (StackOverflow questions) out there</li>
      </ul>
