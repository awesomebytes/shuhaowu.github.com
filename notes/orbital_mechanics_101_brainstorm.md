This document outlines the brainstorming that happened behind post 16: orbital mechanics 101.

Take away of the post
---------------------

The reader should have a basic understanding of the 2 body problem. With a basic understanding of how orbits work in a 2D environment (perifocal reference frame).

List of topics covered
----------------------

 - Newton's 4th law (\frac{GM_1M_2}{r^3}\vec{r}) (Section 1, 1 paragraphs)
     + Quick review.
     + Introduces \mu
     + Statement of equation of motion (\ddot{r} = \frac{-\mu}{r^3}\vec{r})
 - Constants of Keplerian motion (Section 2, 2 paragraphs)
     + Have the reader understand that these are essentially enough to define
       an orbit.
     + Simple statements on angular momentum, orbital energy.
     + Eccentricity vector show direction
 - Basic ellipsis (Section 3, 3 paragraph)
     + Interactive way for the viewer to change the following properties and
       see their effects. No animations.
     + Semimajor axis (a)
     + Semiminor axis (b)
     + Eccentricity (e)
     + True anomaly (theta)
     + Orbit equation (r = \frac{p}{1+e\cos(\theta)})
     + Terminologies: Apoapsis, periapsis
 - Types of orbits (1 paragraph)
     - Quickly introduce the orbits
     - Circular orbit
     - Parabolic orbit
     - Hyperbolic orbit
 - Kepler's laws
     + Animation showing slowed down near apoapsis
     + orbital period depends only on semimajor axis
     + vis viva equation
     + animation at the end showing an orbit, with interactivity + animations
